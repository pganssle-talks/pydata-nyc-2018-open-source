Notes:

Without context it's not possible to properly review a contribution. If I handed you this thing, would you be able to tell me how good it is at... whatever it does? But if I tell you it's a device that uses a dropped weight to launch ping pong balls, you can start imagining how it works.

Maintainers probably aren't having the problem you are having, and even if you picked something off the issue tracker, there's a good chance they haven't looked at that particular issue or the module you're modifying in ages.

Have a clear statement in the PR saying what problem you're attempting to solve and a plain-text explanation of how you solved the problem to provide the context needed for someone to jump right into a review.
