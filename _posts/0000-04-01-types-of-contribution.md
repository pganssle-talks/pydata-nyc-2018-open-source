Note:

The most exciting contributions are going to be adding new features. A new feature is obviously visible and increases the abilities of the project.

You may be wondering why I chose this stock image of a stairway to nowhere to represent new features, and it's because depending on your perspective this image can be a metaphor for *all kinds* of new feature interactions.

Maybe it represents the state of the project *before* the contribution. As a new contributor, you see this stairway going to nowhere and think, "It would be great if I put a door here, everyone would love that new feature!" On the other hand, maybe the maintainer started building those stairs and eventually realized a door really doesn't work in that part of the house; they'd rather you ripped down the old stairs, which is not nearly as fun as building a door.

Another possibility is that it represents the state of the project *after* the contribution. As a new contributor, you see a house that could really use an extra door, and what does the door need? Stairs! So you build some stairs and say, "Here you go!" It's absolutely true that if the maintainer was going to build a door there, you made their job easier by building the stairs, but now the project is in a bewildering half-finished state.

These differences of perspective are a major source of friction between contributors and maintainers, and they are *most* prominent when adding new features. As such, you want to make sure that before you add a new feature, you discuss it thoroughly with the maintainers, and be prepared for a fairly drawn-out review process.

Note:

Bug fixes are probably what most people think of when they think of contributing to open source. While the line between "bug fix" and "feature" is fuzzy, but generally if the program is doing something *other than what was intended*, that's a bug. It's much easier to get bug fixes merged than new features.

Note:
An often overlooked type of contribution issues, but user-submitted issues are one of the only ways that maintainers get feedback about their projects.

Note:

Documentation fixes are among the easiest things to get merged, for a number of reasons.
