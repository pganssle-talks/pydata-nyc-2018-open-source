Notes:

I have found one of the best ways to dig deep into a topic is to help other people with *their* issues. Sometimes these end up being real bugs in the software, other times it just helps you get a feel for how the software works and where the pain points are.

You can hang out on the project's preferred chat medium - IRC, gitter, what have you. If the project has a tag on StackOverflow you can watch it. Also, subscribing to the issue tracker and helping to triage issues as they come in is both very valuable for the project and a great way to "learn by teaching".
