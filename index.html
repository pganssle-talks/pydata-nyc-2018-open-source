## Provide context

     alt="A complicated-looking contraption made from household items"
     style="max-height: 750px"

<!-- ["2015-03-05 contraption"](https://www.flickr.com/photos/29233640@N07/16707597726) by [Robert Couse-Baker](https://www.flickr.com/people/29233640@N07/) is licensed under [CC BY 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0) -->

Notes:

Without context it's not possible to properly review a contribution. If I handed you this thing, would you be able to tell me how good it is at... whatever it does? But if I tell you it's a device that uses a dropped weight to launch ping pong balls, you can start imagining how it works.

Maintainers probably aren't having the problem you are having, and even if you picked something off the issue tracker, there's a good chance they haven't looked at that particular issue or the module you're modifying in ages.

Have a clear statement in the PR saying what problem you're attempting to solve and a plain-text explanation of how you solved the problem to provide the context needed for someone to jump right into a review.

						# Types of contribution

## Features

<img id="splash"
     src="external-images/stairway-to-nowhere.jpg"
     alt="A small stairway leading to a wall"
     style="height: 750px"
     />

<!-- ["You had one job...!(stairway to nowhere)"](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alexchaffee/22466115412) by [Alex Chaffee](https://www.flickr.com/people/alexchaffee/) is licensed under [CC BY 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0) -->

Note:

The most exciting contributions are going to be adding new features. A new feature is obviously visible and increases the abilities of the project.

You may be wondering why I chose this stock image of a stairway to nowhere to represent new features, and it's because depending on your perspective this image can be a metaphor for *all kinds* of new feature interactions.

Maybe it represents the state of the project *before* the contribution. As a new contributor, you see this stairway going to nowhere and think, "It would be great if I put a door here, everyone would love that new feature!" On the other hand, maybe the maintainer started building those stairs and eventually realized a door really doesn't work in that part of the house; they'd rather you ripped down the old stairs, which is not nearly as fun as building a door.

Another possibility is that it represents the state of the project *after* the contribution. As a new contributor, you see a house that could really use an extra door, and what does the door need? Stairs! So you build some stairs and say, "Here you go!" It's absolutely true that if the maintainer was going to build a door there, you made their job easier by building the stairs, but now the project is in a bewildering half-finished state.

These differences of perspective are a major source of friction between contributors and maintainers, and they are *most* prominent when adding new features. As such, you want to make sure that before you add a new feature, you discuss it thoroughly with the maintainers, and be prepared for a fairly drawn-out review process.

## Bug fixes

<img id="splash"
     src="external-images/nowshad-arefin-484188-unsplash-cropped.jpg"
     alt="A foot about to step on a bug"
     />

<!-- Photo by [Nowshad Arefin](https://unsplash.com/@_nowshad_himel_) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/tTHUqB0FNWA) -->

Note:

Bug fixes are probably what most people think of when they think of contributing to open source. While the line between "bug fix" and "feature" is fuzzy, but generally if the program is doing something *other than what was intended*, that's a bug. It's much easier to get bug fixes merged than new features.

## Bug reports

<img id="splash"
     src="external-images/bug-report-woskay.jpg"
     alt="Person pressing the 'Send Error Report' button"

Note:
An often overlooked type of contribution issues, but user-submitted issues are one of the only ways that maintainers get feedback about their projects.

--

## Documentation fixes

<img id="splash"

Note:

Documentation fixes are among the easiest things to get merged, for a number of reasons.

Notes:

I have found one of the best ways to dig deep into a topic is to help other people with *their* issues. Sometimes these end up being real bugs in the software, other times it just helps you get a feel for how the software works and where the pain points are.

You can hang out on the project's preferred chat medium - IRC, gitter, what have you. If the project has a tag on StackOverflow you can watch it. Also, subscribing to the issue tracker and helping to triage issues as they come in is both very valuable for the project and a great way to "learn by teaching".
